/**
 * <!-- START SNIPPET: description -->
 *
 * This interceptor forms the core functionality of the exception handling feature. Exception handling allows you to map
 * an exception to a result code, just as if the action returned a result code instead of throwing an unexpected
 * exception. When an exception is encountered, it is wrapped with an {@link ExceptionHolder} and pushed on the stack,
 * providing easy access to the exception from within your result.
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> While you can configure exception mapping in your configuration file at any point, the configuration
 * will not have any effect if this interceptor is not in the interceptor stack for your actions. It is recommended that
 * you make this interceptor the first interceptor on the stack, ensuring that it has full access to catch any
 * exception, even those caused by other interceptors.
