/**
 * <code>EnumTypeConverter</code>
 *
 * <!-- START SNIPPET: description -->
 * This class converts java 5 enums to String and from String[] to enum.
 * <p/>
 * One of Java 5's improvements is providing enumeration facility.
 * Up to now, there existed no enumerations. The only way to simulate was the so-called int Enum pattern:
 * {code}
 * public static final int SEASON_WINTER = 0;
 * public static final int SEASON_SPRING = 1;
 * public static final int SEASON_SUMMER = 2;
 * public static final int SEASON_FALL   = 3;
 * {code}
 * <p/>
 * Java 5.0 now provides the following construct:
 * {code}
 * public static enum Season { WINTER, SPRING, SUMMER, FALL };
 * {code}
 * <!-- END SNIPPET: description -->

 * <p/>
 * 1. myAction-conversion.properties*
 * <p/>
 * Place a myAction-conversion.properties-file in the path of your Action.
 * Add the following entry to the properties-file:
 * {code}
 * nameOfYourField=fullyClassifiedNameOfYourConverter
 * {code}
 * &nbsp;
 * <p/>
 * 2. myAction.java*
 * Your action contains the _enumeration_:
 * {code}
 * public enum Criticality {DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, FATAL}
 * {code}
 * &nbsp;
 * * Your action contains the _private field_:
 * {code}
 * private myEnum myFieldForEnum;
 * {code}
 * &nbsp;
 * Your action contains _getters and setters_ for your field:
 * {code}
 * public myEnum getCriticality() {
 *         return myFieldForEnum;
 *     }
 *
 *     public void setCriticality(myEnum myFieldForEnum) {
 *         this.myFieldForEnum= myFieldForEnum;
 *     }
 * {code}
